Vehicles are among the main sources — even though we have moved to cleaner fuel, the sheer number of vehicles on Indian roads is negating gains. There is also industrial pollution — much comes from burning coal which industry resorts to as the cost of electricity is high. Even though gas is available at lower prices in Delhi, for instance, industry is no longer based only in official industrial areas but has spread into non-authorised areas where the use of polluting fuel continues. Although coal has been banned in the entire National Capital Region (NCR), alternative fuel or natural gas isn’t under GST and hence, it is taxed heavily. Gas prices are thrice the cost of coal and given how electricity prices are also substantial, polluting fuels continue as industries see no alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the burning of waste — unlike other regions in India, where waste management practices have improved significantly, the NCR is failing to deal with the mountains of waste it generates. Consequently, whether it is landfill fires or smaller heaps being lit, waste burning is a major cause of air pollution now. Dust from construction, etc., also becomes a pollutant when solid particles from combustion are lifted into the wind, creating airborne particles which are inhaled. Household-related emissions are a cause as well — economically weaker sections in the outlying areas of large cities often have no option but to still use firewood, etc., to cook.\"\"\"\n",
